## This is a demonstration on how you can speed up vanilla python code. 

***
1. first folder is vanilla Python
2. second is compiled to c with Cython
3. third has type declarations included

Here is a one run of all of the programs. As we can see optimized code is 155 times faster. ðŸ¤”

PS.
If u want to run this u need to give bash script permissions.
```bash
chmod u+x script
```
Remember to read script carefully before :))
