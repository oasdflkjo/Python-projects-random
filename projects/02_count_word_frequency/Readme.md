## Using hashmap in python (dictinary)
***
Simplified steps:

1. program reads file one line at a time to a string

2. filters out unnecessary symbols from the string
3. separates words in to a list
4. places words from the list into a dictionary
5. uses dictinary value as a counter

For now it prints sorted list of words and their counters if the counter is greater than 100.
